# Fümblr

* Fümblr is a Full-Stack application that utilizes a React-Redux front end and a Postgresql, Ruby on Rails backend!

* This site is a clone (with a twist) of the social media/blogging site tumblr. My focus is on what is viral in ALL of the sports world therefore my inspiration for this application was to put a sports twist on the site, allowing users to post text, quotes, photos, and any funny memes or gifs that tend to go viral in the sports world. My focus is on what is viral in ALL of the sports world.

* My application is unique from tumblr because of its Real-time sports API which displays scores for Major Sports leagues. However, currently it is a free api, therefore I am unable to access the array of sports I would like to display (such as the WNBA, Womens Soccer, Tennis). Also, because it is currently a free API, only scores that are not of the current year may be displayed.


* Again, Fümblr allows users to post text posts such as statuses or whatever may be on the user's mind as well as empowering, funny, or any variety of quotes authored by famous sports idols such as Serena Williams or of the user.
